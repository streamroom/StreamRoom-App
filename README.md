## Overview
### Description
Allows the user to choose their favorite genres and artists and then suggests them to a group to join. User joins groups and users can suggest new music and group can vote up or vote down music to add to the shared playlists.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** Would mainly be made to work for mobile only. It could be available on a computer but we imagine that it would mainly be used for mobile. The idea is to have it be an easily accessible app for people and easy to use.
- **Story:** Takes users favorite genres and artists and suggests stream rooms for the user. Once in a group, other members can vote on music and create a joint playlist for all to listen to and enjoy. Made to discover new music as well.
- **Market:** This app is made for all music lovers who are looking for new music or people who enjoy the same music taste as them. Puts you into groups with similar music tastes so there is reason to have to listen to music you do not enjoy. 
- **Habit:** User can use it as they please. If they just want to listen to music 24/7 then it would be perfect for them. They can listen to new music and never get tired of the same old songs.
- **Scope:** We would love to have this app have a way for the users to chat and suggest concerts and get involved in the music community.
